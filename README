ghdl-lang-server is a language server for VHDL based on ghdl.

It implements the Language Server Protocol.
The server is implemented in Python (3.x) but relies on libghdl for parsing.


To install:
1) First install ghdl (add --enable-python during configuration).
   This is needed so that the libraries are available
2) In ghdl, install libghdl.  There is a setup.py script, so you can do:
   $ pip install .
IMPORTANT: always use the latest version of ghdl (the python binding may
 have incompatible changes)
3) Install ghdl-ls (from ghdl-language-server):
   $ pip install .
   To install for development: pip install -e .
   Add --user to install in your home directory.
4) You can install the vscode extension:
   $ cd vscode-client
   $ vsce package
   $ code --install-extension vhdl-lsp-*.vsix

The executable is named 'ghdl-ls'.  It uses stdin/stdout to communicate with
its client.
