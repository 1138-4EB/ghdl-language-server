Various ideas of improvements (in no specific order):

* reformat: realign (per scope or per block) associations/declarations
* parse after a timeout instead of after each edit (but what about testing?)
* go to declaration/definition -> for components and subprograms
* action: add instance: ghdl prefix, no generics if none.
* action: reorder associations (using the declaration order)
* action: convert from assoc by position to assoc by name
* action: add missing associations (to open)
* update messages for dependences ?
* find references
* manage memory: un-analyze, free old nodes...
* verilog ?
* Import projects from ISE, Vivado, quartus, HDLmake, ...
* integration with other IDE (emacs, atom, ...)
* Test on windows, MacOS
* Watch/edit project file ?
* Sanitize tests
* add file into project
* project: add library.
* watch project file and reload.
* add a signal or jump to declarations
* style checker
* vscode: add a option to enable logs.

* crash: invalid character (S-zet)
* crash: file in library doesn't exist anymore
